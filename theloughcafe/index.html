								<h3>The Lough</h3>
								<p>Discover the charm of The Lough. The Lough is one of Cork's most beloved attractions, known for its tranquil waters, diverse wildlife, and scenic walk. This freshwater lake is home to a variety of bird species. Whether you're taking a leisurely stroll or feeding the ducks, The Lough provides a beautiful backdrop for your time at our cafe.</P> 
								<P>The Lough is a shallow spring-fed freshwater lake with an average depth of one metre and a total area of 4 hectares. It is a wildfowl preserve, particularly for swans, and has been a protected area since 1881. The Lough is also used for coarse angling (on a 'strictly catch and release basis')[3] and is home to fish species such as carp, eel, tench, rudd and perch. The outer border of the body of water at the Lough is approximately 1.1 kilometres (0.68 mi).</p>
